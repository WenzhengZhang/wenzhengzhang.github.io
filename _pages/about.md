I am a fourth-year PhD candidate at Rutgers University, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Karl Stratos](http://karlstratos.com/). I received my M.S. in Computer Science from Rutgers in Spring 2021, and prior to that, I earned a B.S. in Applied Physics from the University of Science and Technology of China in 2019.  

Research Interests
======
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation
- Entity-Centric Language Understanding 

I am also open to exploring new research directions and have recently become particularly interested in the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).
