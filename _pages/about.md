I am an AI researcher specializing in natural language processing and large language models. I received my PhD in Computer Science from Rutgers University in October 2025, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Karl Stratos](http://karlstratos.com/). I previously earned an M.S. in Computer Science from Rutgers University in 2021 and a B.S. in Applied Physics from the University of Science and Technology of China in 2019.
