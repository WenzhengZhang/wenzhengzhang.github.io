title: About Me
---

I am a third-year PhD student at Rutgers University. I'm fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Karl Stratos](http://karlstratos.com/). I received M.S. in CS from Rutgers in Spring 2021. Prior to RU, I graduated from University of Science and Technology of China with a B.S. in Applied Physics.  My research interests are  Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
