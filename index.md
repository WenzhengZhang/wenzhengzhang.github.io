title: About Me
---

I am a fourth-year PhD student at Rutgers University. I'm fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Karl Stratos](http://karlstratos.com/). I received M.S. in CS from Rutgers in Spring 2021. Prior to RU, I graduated from University of Science and Technology of China with a B.S. in Applied Physics.  My research broadly lies in Natural Language Processing. Currently, my research tends towards Retrieval Augmented Generation, Knowledge-intensive Language Processing, Information Retrieval, and Coreference Resolution, but I remain open to exploring other research directions. 

**I am actively seeking research scientist or engineer roles. Please feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss opportunities.**
